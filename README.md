# Zeb-Dolphin

Zeb-Dolphin is a P2P browser designed to visualize the data transmission process in a peer-to-peer network. It provides an interactive and intuitive graphical representation of data flow, helping users understand and analyze the communication between nodes.

## Features

- **Visual Data Transmission**: Graphical representation of data flow in a P2P network.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Use D3.js to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.
- **TypeScript & React**: Built with modern web technologies for robustness and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hetu-project/zeb-dolphin.git
   cd zeb-dolphin
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a graph representing the P2P network. Each node represents a peer, and the edges represent data transmission between peers. You can interact with the graph to explore the data flow and analyze the communication patterns.
